# gazebo_contact_pkgs

Improved gazebo contact task simulation packages

Aimed to be a mujoco-like physics engine for Gazebo to improve its contact simulation.

Four ways to improve this thing:
- fix gazebo source code for support fine contact simulation
- create new gazebo plugins for specific things
- improve the ODE engine and other existing physics engine
- create new physics engine
